# golfyou

The project was copied from [here](https://github.com/uva-cs4730-s23/game-golfyou), and has been done so so I can continue to modify the files if needed, since the old repo is non-editable.

This was my group's final project for CS 4730 (Computer Game Design) at the University of Virginia. The game is called *Golf You*, a 2-D sidescrolling platformer, written using MonoGame (a C# game framework).

You can view the repo here, or download the final version from our group at [this link](http://cs4730.games) (choose the project with the golf icon), which was how the project looked when it was demoed.

# golfyou

The project was copied from [here](https://github.com/uva-cs4730-s23/game-golfyou), and has been done so so I can continue to modify the files if needed, since the old repo is non-editable.

This was my group's final project for CS 4730 (Computer Game Design) at the University of Virginia. The game is called *Golf You*, a 2-D sidescrolling platformer, written using MonoGame (a C# game framework).
